## 🚀 Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository

You have two options to clone the repository:

#### Option 1: Command Line

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-ORG-NAME/YOUR-TEAM-REPO.git
```

#### Option 2: Command Palette

1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (Mac)
2. Type "git clone"
3. Paste the repository URL (from the "Clone" button on GitHub)
4. Choose your destination folder

## 🌿 Branching Workflow

Always work on a separate branch. Never push directly to main.

1. **Create a new branch** for each task or feature:

   ```bash
   git branch -c your-name/feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** locally

   - Work on your files as needed
   - Save your progress often

3. **Stage and commit** your changes:

   ```bash
   git add .
   # OR
   git add specific-file-name

   git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message"
   ```

4. **Push your branch** to GitHub:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature-your-name
   # OR
   git push origin head
   ```

5. **Open a Pull Request (PR)**
   - Go to the repo on GitHub
   - Click "Compare & pull request"
   - Add a short description of your changes
   - Tag a teammate to review it

Once approved, it can be safely merged into main.

## 📌 Commit Message Tips

Write clear, useful messages that explain what and why:

- `Add quantum state simulation function`
- `Fix matrix dimensions in tensor product`
- `Update README with cloning instructions`

## 🔁 Keeping Your Repo Up to Date

Always sync with the main branch before starting new work:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
# Then create your feature branch from the updated main
```

## 🧠 Best Practices

- ✅ One branch per feature or fix
- ✅ Pull frequently to avoid merge conflicts
- ✅ Keep your code well-commented and organized
- ✅ Use README.md for explanations
- ✅ Track bugs, tasks, or ideas with GitHub Issues
